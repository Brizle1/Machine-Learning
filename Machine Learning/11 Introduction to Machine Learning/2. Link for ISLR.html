<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>The ISLR webpage that I mention in the next lecture has changed slightly, the free pdf book is now available right on the home page. You can check the resource for this lecture for a direct link.</p><p>You can also find a zip file in the resources here of the pdf versions of the presentations I give throughout this section of the course.</p><p>Thanks!</p>
